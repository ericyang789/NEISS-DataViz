# NEISS-DataViz
The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) collects data on consumer product-related injuries occuring in the United States. With more than 4 million observations dating back to 2008 recorded in tabular form, there is a need for a visualization platform to perform exploratory analyses on this large data set. Using RShiny and tidyverse packages, I created a reactive dashboard that allows user customization for graphical displays of NEISS data. The flexible application enables different subsets, facets and groups based on patient demographic and injury diagnoses to help users observe trends in the database.
